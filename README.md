Wax-Tracks
==========

Website for local record store 

There are a lot of young people in Madison, Wisconsin studying at the University of Wisconsin. It’s not 
surprising that WaxTracks, a local record store, has managed to remain profitable even as MP3s have replaced CD’s. 
WaxTracks specializes in new and used vinyl. They’d like you to design a landing page for a new web site they want 
to create where customers can place orders online. For this project, they’d like you to design and code up a prototype 
for a landing page for the site. Note that we’re just working on the homepage here, not the entire website. They want 
it to be appealing to young, music-savvy customers. The landing page should be visually appealing and should contain 
links to their online store (which you will not be designing or building). If you choose to work on this scenario, 
do a Google image search for pictures to include on the landing page. You can pretend the pictures were supplied by 
the record store.
